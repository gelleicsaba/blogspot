Rider on Linux
ASP.Net
It is very nice that Rider has a community version too, but I can't run or debug fistly on linux. But dont worry about it, you have to set "DOTNET_ROOT" in launch settings "environmentVariables" section and everything will be OK. Rider is a great choice if you want to use your .net project on linux.

Micro could be your fav. base editor
Command tools
I always like the terminal based text editors, like vim or nano, but I prefer more the micro because it's very easy to use. You can change the color theme, you can install another nice plugins like this: [link "https://github.com/NicolaiSoeborg/filemanager-plugin"]Filemanager-plugin[/link]. Micro support the splitted editor parts too, like vim does.

Replace your PC for a new OS minor ver.? Nice future :)
OS
It is a bad idea that you have to change the PC when you change an OS minor version. I dont want to mention specific products. I say that you can use Manjaro and you can enjoy the neverending rolling updates for free :)

Tailwind and utility classes
HTML/CSS
You don't need to know the component classes and uniqe class names. You can use a specific tailwind class for every UI component. Almost everything are there on tailwind css that you need, and the search box will help to find that you need on the tailwind site. It is superb.

Python
I know that Flutter or React Native are fashion nowadays to build native apps, but Python is leader programming language in 2024 as the statistics show. We don't know what the future will be but Beeware might be I think. There are strong community support and cost effective like Flutter/Dart is.

Boost your app with Redis
Web apps
Put a layer between database and service in the application. It can be Redis, that is like a cache system. It supports key-value storage and queries, transactions, and many data types & structures. Redis can be better choice like other in-build in memory database systems.
